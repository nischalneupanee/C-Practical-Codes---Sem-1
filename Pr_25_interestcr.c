a) If a deposit is less than Rs. 1,000 and for 2 or more years the interest rate is 5 percent
compounded annually.
b) If a deposit is Rs. 1,000 or more but less than Rs. 5,000 and for 2 or more years the
interest rate is 7 percent compounded annually.
c) If a deposit is more than Rs. 5,000 and is for 1 year or more the interest rate is 8 percent
compounded annually.
d) On all deposits for 5 years or more interest is 10 percent compounded annually
e) On all other deposits not covered by the above conditions the interest is 3 percent
compounded annually.
At the time of withdrawal a customer data is given with the amount deposited and the
number of years the money has been with the bank. Write a program to obtain the money in
the customerâ€™s account and the interest credited at the time on withdrawal.*/
